# MRContact
The Contact Us form page and Campus Ambassador Form page for Mentored-Research.

This contains 2 forms for Mentored-Research's contact requirements. 
Form 1 is a simple contact us form and form 2 is a campus mbassador form.

The contact form and campus ambassador forms are validated using validator.js(from Bootstrap). 

the buttons are wired up with jQuery AJAX, the request of which is handled by PHP code at the back end. 
The back end functions are contained in AJAXFunctions.php and helpers.php
Pay special attention to the "no" field that goes as data in the jQuery AJAX code. This number("no") field decides that function is called.

There are mail functions,built into PHP only, for the mailing requirements on this page.
